Feel free to simply zip back up the entire folder for your submission.  Within this notebook, work in between the exercise cells and be clear about your answers.  For example, you should add cells below the cell starting with 1.1 for the answer to 1.1.  You can break your answers into as many cells as you like.  Please do not clear your output so that we can see your answers without running all of the cells.  Edit the html file directly and view with a web browser and using `python -m http.server` to check it.  You may need to debug the javascript, in which case your should use your dev tools and then look at the \"console\"."
